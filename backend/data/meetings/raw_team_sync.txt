Govinda: So, anyone fixed the backend deployment error yet?
Sanchari: Not yet. It’s something to do with the API key not being loaded from the environment file.
Rahul: Yeah, that’s what I thought too. I tried printing the env vars — it’s blank.
Govinda: Okay, I’ll check that after this call. Sneha, did the frontend auth integration finish?
Sanchari: Yup, it’s done. I added token persistence too.
Neha: Oh and about the hackathon slides — I’ve started preparing them. We can rehearse on Sunday maybe?
Rahul: By the way, the ML model’s accuracy improved by 5%, so that’s good news.
Govinda: Great! Rahul, can you retrain with the new dataset and upload the model file by Monday?
Rahul: Sure thing.
Sanchari: I’ll push my latest code to GitHub after lunch.
Neha: Cool, I’ll finalize the presentation by tomorrow.
